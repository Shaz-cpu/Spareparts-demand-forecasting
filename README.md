Spare Parts Demand Forecasting


This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast spare parts demand for a service center, helping it move toward a Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory system. Using historical job card and invoice data, the model predicts demand for categorized spare parts to optimize inventory management and reduce overstock or stockouts.

Key Highlights

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Spare Parts Categorization (503 parts grouped into 5 categories)
Predictive Modeling using machine learning algorithms
Evaluation Metrics to assess model accuracy and performance
